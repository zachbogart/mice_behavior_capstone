# History of Research Ethics

## Overview
- human subject research oversight has been historically very reactionary
- Nuremberg Code, National Research Act of 1974

### History
- At the time of Nuremberg, there were no regulations in place
- **3 basic elements of the code**:
    1. Voluntary and informed consent
    2. Favorable risk-to-benefit analysis
    3. right to withdraw without repercussions
- First legislation related to human-subjects research was for prohibiting jury deliberations (privacy is involved)
- Novel Elements from Declaration of Helsinki:
    1.  The interests of the subject should always be placed above the interests of society
    2. Every subject should get the best known treatment
- Tuskegee syphilis study
    - violated the Helsinki seconds element
    - Known to have syphilis yet not treated; did not receive best known treatment
    - led to need for federal oversight
- **the Belmont Report (1978)**:
- Minimum Requirements:
    1. Respect for persons
        - persons must voluntarily consent to participate in Research
        - the consent must be informed
        - privacy and confidentiality must be protected
        - right to withdraw without repercussions
    2. beneficence
        - max benefit, min harm
        - in other words, the risks must be justified
    3. justice
        - dist of risk across society
        - Study should not systematically select people simply because they are easy to manipulate or readily available
        - instead, chosen based on *content of research*

### Data Science Connection
- We are working in a field that is often responsible for/privy to highly sensitive and personal information.
- The history of consent and human rights in studies have been developed often in response to war atrocities and horrible studies.
- It is important that we learn from these choices and how they have shaped the landscape of personal accountability and respect for the subjects involved.
- Data Science is by definition interdisciplinary and exposed to a lot of highly personal info about individuals. It is important to remember that the data comes from individuals and that it needs to be treated fairly and with respect

### Summary
- researchers were once left alone in terms of human-subject responsibility
- IRB (institutional review boards): review studies to make sure they take into accounts the rights of human subjects
- **Nuremberg Trials**: Nazi medical doctors on trial for atrocities done to prisoners (disease test cultures, extreme conditioning)
    - condemned doctors, leading to *Nuremberg Code*
- University of Chicago recorded jury deliberations without knowledge of the jurors
    - led to prohibition of jury recordings
- Congressional legislation led to enforcement of informed consent
- Yale study to shock others to see whether subjects will respect authority and under what conditions
    - cause uproar; people were not told and they believed they were doing horrible acts
- Tuskegee study followed syphilis subjects. Subjects were unaware they had the disease and they were not given treatment.
- Refinement of the protection of human subjects continues
