# Meeting 3 (10-17-2018)

## Prep
Having cracked open the data to the point that it can easily be accessed, we began running preliminary exploratory data analysis as well as feature engineering. We split into two groups: one worked on creating features from the data and saving it to the csv. The other team did some preliminary exploration of the data. Currently, the csv does not contain all of the mice trials. But the feature engineering team is working on creating novel features and rerunning it on the raw data collection.

## Summary
- Transition to use Google backup to get drive locally and run to create master CSV file
- Focus on the features and getting them to visually be displayed to see differences between strains

## TODO
- Locally download all files (using absolute .txt file) and create master CSV for analysis
- is_safe change to length of the mouse
- average size of the mouse, explore
- plots of features for PO, BW
    - of all four strains
    - plot by feature, look at differences
    - use violin plots with scatterplot layer as discussed at the end
    - can look at cross correlations of all the features later on

- plan a meeting for this Friday
  - work on report, due Monday
  - Have finished CSV for working on plotting and modeling
