# Meeting 1 (09-20-2018)

## Summary
In our first meeting, we met with professor Andres and he gave us a keynote presentation on the project and its background.

The **goal** of the project is to explore how behavior is related to genetics using data collected from mice trials. Interested in seeing if behaviors can be quantified as features and see how they relate to genetic data.

## Setup
- Videos of ~1600 mice were collected by Andres' lab for two species (~1600 each): *peromyscus polionotus* (oldfield mice) and *peromyscus maniculatus* (deer mice)
- the lab has concluded that the differences in exploration strategies between species suggest strong heritable components. They found this by swapping rat pups and seeing no significant difference in behavior as a result.
- The videos are about 5 minutes in length and show rats navigating an **elevated plus maze**. This maze has sections with walls (mice feel safe) and without.
- The two different species have drastically different behaviors in the maze: oldfield mice explore the open spaces much more than the deer mice.
- The rats are **hybrids**, meaning they have different combinations of genes from the two species.

## Data
- The videos have already been classified by the lab, creating data files that show the position of the mouse as well as its centroid and size
- A variety of possible features were discussed: position, velocity, turn preference (species seem to show pref for turn out of maze), size, zone of maze, etc.
- We will later look at the genetic data: 0.5M SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that we can use to look at differences in mice that display certain behaviors on above features.

## TODO
- We are meeting soon as a student team to discuss the data and a plan of attack.
- The main focus will be on understanding the data and quantifying features
- Preliminary EDA
